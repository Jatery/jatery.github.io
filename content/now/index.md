## What I'm Doing Now

### Currently Course Learning

- Machine Learning. Professor Lee did a great job, just going to finish the last few homeworks.
- Computer System Lab. Final project now working on a self-sailing maze-running boat :speedboat:. Not sure how to complete the PID control and the maze algorithm, but other parts are working well.

### Currently Off Course Learning

- NTU Digital Music Composition Club. Just finished the teaching of the club. Currently having two compositions written in the club but not published yet.

### Currently Attending

- Just finished our CSIE Night 2025 in our department (2025/05/15). I've played the keyboard in our band and a wotagei solo performance. I've also been the photographer in the event. Will attend next year, hopefully.

### Currently Playing

- Arknights. Have played for almost 5 years, but currently not playing much. Mint lover.
- Genshin Impact. Have played for over 2 years, but currently not playing much, less than Arknights. Finally going to have a 5-star weapon for LingHua.
- Sky: Children of the Light. Have played on and off for almost 6 years?! Now playing daily with my friend for the new season.

### Currently Following Animes

- Shoshimin Series S2. I've read the original novel, so I'm just looking foward to the animation.
- Mono Girls. Just photographing + traveling + girls doing cute things.
